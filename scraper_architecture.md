# Web Scraper Architecture for Security Leads Automation

## Overview
The security leads automation system will be designed as a modular, extensible web scraping framework that can extract contact information from various sources identified in our research. The system will be built with Python, leveraging popular libraries for web scraping, data processing, and storage.

## System Components

### 1. Core Framework
- **Scraper Manager**: Central controller that orchestrates the scraping process
- **Configuration Manager**: Handles settings, credentials, and scraping parameters
- **Logging System**: Records operations, errors, and statistics
- **Proxy Rotator**: Manages IP rotation to avoid rate limiting and blocking
- **User Agent Rotator**: Cycles through different browser identities

### 2. Source-Specific Scrapers
Each source will have a dedicated scraper module implementing a common interface:
- **InstantMarkets Scraper**: For government RFPs and contracts
- **BidNetDirect Scraper**: For security service bids
- **USAJOBS Scraper**: For federal security positions
- **Security Jobs Network Scraper**: For specialized security job listings
- **Security Guards Only Scraper**: For security guard positions
- **Generic Job Board Scraper**: Adaptable for Indeed, LinkedIn (when accessible)

### 3. Data Extraction Components
- **HTML Parser**: Extracts structured data from HTML
- **PDF Parser**: Extracts text from PDF documents (for RFP details)
- **Contact Extractor**: Specialized module for finding emails, phones, and contact names
- **Company Identifier**: Extracts and normalizes company/organization names

### 4. Data Processing Pipeline
- **Deduplication Engine**: Removes duplicate leads
- **Validation Module**: Verifies email formats, phone numbers, etc.
- **Enrichment Module**: Adds additional information from secondary sources
- **Classification Module**: Categorizes leads by type (event, construction, etc.)

### 5. Storage System
- **Database Manager**: Handles database operations
- **Lead Database**: Stores extracted leads with metadata
- **Export Module**: Generates reports in various formats (CSV, Excel, etc.)

### 6. Scheduling and Automation
- **Task Scheduler**: Manages periodic scraping jobs
- **Monitoring System**: Tracks system health and performance
- **Notification System**: Alerts on new leads, errors, or system issues

## Data Flow

1. **Configuration**: System loads settings and schedules
2. **Source Selection**: Scraper Manager selects appropriate source scrapers
3. **Data Acquisition**: Source scrapers fetch raw data from websites
4. **Parsing**: HTML/PDF parsers extract structured data
5. **Contact Extraction**: Contact information is identified and extracted
6. **Validation**: Data is validated for format and completeness
7. **Deduplication**: Duplicate leads are identified and merged
8. **Enrichment**: Additional information is added where possible
9. **Storage**: Validated leads are stored in the database
10. **Reporting**: Results are formatted for export or notification

## Technical Stack

- **Programming Language**: Python 3.10+
- **Web Scraping**: Requests, BeautifulSoup4, Selenium, Scrapy
- **Data Processing**: Pandas, NumPy
- **PDF Processing**: PyPDF2, pdfminer
- **Database**: SQLite (development), PostgreSQL (production)
- **Scheduling**: APScheduler
- **Proxy Management**: Rotating proxies service

## Anti-Detection Measures

- **Request Throttling**: Implements delays between requests
- **IP Rotation**: Uses different IP addresses for scraping
- **User-Agent Rotation**: Varies browser identification
- **Session Management**: Maintains cookies and session state
- **Request Patterns**: Randomizes request patterns to mimic human behavior
- **Respect robots.txt**: Checks and follows website scraping policies

## Error Handling

- **Retry Mechanism**: Automatically retries failed requests
- **Graceful Degradation**: Continues operation even if some sources fail
- **Error Logging**: Detailed logging of all errors for debugging
- **Alerting**: Notifies administrators of critical failures

## Scalability Considerations

- **Modular Design**: Easy to add new sources or modify existing ones
- **Parallel Processing**: Ability to scrape multiple sources simultaneously
- **Resource Management**: Controls CPU and memory usage
- **Distributed Option**: Can be extended to run across multiple machines

## Ethical and Legal Considerations

- **Rate Limiting**: Respects website resources by limiting request frequency
- **Terms of Service**: Designed to comply with website terms where possible
- **Data Privacy**: Only collects publicly available business contact information
- **Attribution**: Maintains source information for all collected data
